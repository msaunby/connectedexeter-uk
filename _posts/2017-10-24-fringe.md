### Creating together

Unlike typical hackathons where teams compete to have the best ideas and race to build a working prototype we'll be taking a more collaborative approach.  Of course there will still be opportunity to show off, if that's your thing!

To inspire, challenge and critque ideas, and help create prototypes, we'll be joined by experienced artists, makers and thinkers who work at the interfaces between the Internet and society.
